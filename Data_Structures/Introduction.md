## Data Structure

**Data Structures** [DS] - A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory. It encompasses both the collection of values (the data) and the organization of these values (the structure). By employing data structures, developers can effectively store and retrieve data, as well as perform various other operations in an efficient manner.

**Common operations involving DS**:

    a. Access
    b. Search
    c. Insert
    d. Delete

**Abstract Data Types** [ADT] - Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are high-level descriptions of data structures that specify the operations that can be performed on the data and the properties or constraints associated with those operations. They focus on the behavior and characteristics of the data structure rather than its implementation details. ADTs provide a blueprint or interface for creating data structures and serve as a means of abstraction, allowing programmers to work with data structures without concerning themselves with the underlying implementation. Examples of ADTs include lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

Examples:

    a. List → Dynamic Array; Linked Lists
    b. Queue → Linked Lists based on Queues; Arrays based on Queues; Stack based on Queues
    c. Map → Tree Map; Hash Map; Hash Table
